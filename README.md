# Gazette Client - Distributable Frontend

__Gazette__ is a custom tailored CMS that focuses on deliverying an amazing user/admin experience; We believe in the frontend-first principle;

> Experimental main client for Gazette CMS.

We plan to have 2 distributables types out of this source-code:

- [Experimental] A static generated website that builds & deploys itself from time to time to the repo as the user's interactions are hold in a store in the client and send a request with the updates once at an interval;
- (the traditional one/way) - a SPA that communicates with [the server](link to server repo)

> Nuxt.js project
