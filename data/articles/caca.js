<p>Last month, Apple added 158 new emojis to iOS, but the emoji keyboard on iPhone — the primary means of accessing each of these characters — remains almost identical to the one we used nearly a decade ago.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, people push for competing interests. Some want more emojis to better represent the diverse world we live in while others are frustrated by the ever-increasing list of characters to scroll past when new emojis push old favorites to the side.</p>

<p>“Just make it stop!” my friend Elle remarked after the most recent update, clearly falling in the latter camp of emoji traditionalists.</p>

<p>The two problems have something in common: An ever-increasing library of emojis has started to push our gadgets to the limit. Too many new emojis make it harder to find what you actually want to use on the keyboard, and the keyboard itself can’t accommodate diverse options.</p>

<blockquote>Some want more emojis to represent things like bagels, some don’t want a single new emoji unless the keyboard improves first.</blockquote>

<p>All these issues need to be considered by the Unicode Consortium, the group responsible for approving new emoji characters each year. Unicode acts as the liaison between users and vendors when it comes to managing which new emojis come out when. (Full disclosure: My site, Emojipedia, is a voting Unicode member, and I participate with the emoji subcommittee.)</p>

<p>With a potential onslaught of new emojis on the way in coming years, is the emoji keyboard up to the challenge?</p>

<h2>Competing Interests</h2>

<p>There are three main groups involved in approving, releasing, and using emojis. First, there’s Unicode, which approves and encodes emojis that will be supported by all major vendors — Apple, Google, and Samsung, for example. There’s no point in Unicode approving new emojis if vendors aren’t going to support them on their platforms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, those vendors want emojis that address the needs of their customers while remaining in line with their corporate values. They have a clear incentive to address user demand while also juggling how new additions fit on the keyboard and within the memory constraints of a mobile operating system.</p>

<p>Finally, people who use emojis on products like iOS or WhatsApp want, well, a mix of everything. Some want more emojis to represent things like bagels; some don’t want a single new emoji unless the keyboard improves.</p>

<p>Proposals for new emojis, both from companies and the general public, are assessed by the Unicode Consortium to see if they’ll be included in the Unicode Standard. But Unicode doesn’t handle the art direction for emojis; companies are responsible for how any emoji looks on their platform — which is why a smiley face looks different on an iPhone than a Galaxy — and that can make things complicated. Innovation can only go so far: Should any company stray too far from the rest of the pack, they risk drawing ire from their users. Plus, one company changing an emoji’s appearance won’t determine how it is seen by recipients with phones from different vendors.</p>

<p>For example, one of the biggest issues with Apple unilaterally changing its gun emoji to look like a toy in 2016 wasn’t so much the change itself but the fact that Apple was the only company doing it. The result was cross-platform confusion where a toy water pistol could be sent from an iPhone and arrive as a lethal weapon on a Samsung Galaxy. (All major vendors eventually changed their gun emojis to toys in 2018.)</p>

<p><span class="hl">Consider the wine glass emoji: It depicts red wine, not white, which could reasonably arouse the suspicions of a picky sommelier.</span> If Unicode were to approve a new “white wine” character, it would raise other questions: What about rosé? What about stout or pale ale instead of a general beer? This might seem like nitpicking, but when you have a text-encoding standard that is deployed across billions of devices around the world, being thorough isn’t optional.</p>

<blockquote>No one wants to scroll past 52,000 family emojis to get to the lion or baseball.</blockquote>
